# C++ Programming
C++ is one of my, no it is my favorite programming language. I started coding at the age of 17 from my college "Nilgiri College of arts and science-Tamil Nadu". My BSc in computer science gave me a nice base. During my first few weeks 'the time when I get familiar with my course ' i become so much amazed about not only possibilities and also about cool amazing life with a lot of new things to learn and lot and lots of fun. I can always recall it even when I'm just twelve years old I had been fascinated to learn new things that I couldn't comprehend, I know it's strange. Back to the topic... My first programming language was C. I loved C very much, it was easy for me and also fun. C introduced me to this gorgeous new wonderland. In the second semester, I learned C++, and I had to admit it was truly awesome. For the first time in my life, I thought that I got a new superpower. C++ made me a programmer teach me to solve problems, it showed me this wonderful world. The structure of C++ teaches me to understand any programming language easily, and its object-oriented programming concepts are deep and teach me how the objects and classes work. these a few of my early day's codes that I have done from college and home and I believe that it's enough to interest this language.
