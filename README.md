# Early days with Cpp
C++ is one of my, no it is my favourite programing language.
I started coding at the age of 17 from my collage "Nilgiri collage of arts and science-tamil nadu".
My BSc computer science gave me a nice base. During my first few weeks 'the time when i get familiar with my course ' i become so much amazed about the not only possiblities and also about cool amazing life with lot of new things to learn and lot and lots of fun. I can always recall it even when i'm just twelve years old i had been fascinated to learn new things that i couldn't comprehend, i know its strange.
Back to the topic....
My first programing language was C. i loved C very much ,it was easy to me and also fun.
C actually introduced me to this gorgeous new wonderland. 
On the second semester i learned C++, and i had to admit it was trully awesome. For the first time in my life i thought that i got an new super power.


Why C++ is my favourite?

1.	I love c++ because it is fast, powerful and somewhat complex, and i love things which are more powerfull even if it is ancient, actually C++ is not so ancient, it is still wildly used for a number of reasons.

2.	The other reason why i love C++, that is it was my first programing language that i had properly learned,and i impressed by it's power and complete control. At the time when i was learning thise language i had wish that one day i will do a huge project with just C++.

The benefits that i got from C++

Actually C++ made me a programmer teach me to solve problems , it showed this wonderful world.
The structure of C++ teach me to understand any programing language easly, and it's object oriented programing concepts are deep and teach me how the objects and classes works. these a few of my early days codes that i done from collage and home and i believe that it's enough to interest to this language.
